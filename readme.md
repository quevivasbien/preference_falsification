# Preference falsification

This library is meant to model preference falsification in a sequential voting game.

The file `gen_efg.py` contains code that generates a `.efg` file, which represents an extensive-form game for the `gambit` software library. You do not need to have `gambit` installed to run this code, but you will need it to analyze the resulting game (find Nash equilibria).
